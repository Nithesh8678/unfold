# RefAid Frontend Development Roadmap

This document outlines the plan for the frontend development of the **RefAid** decentralized platform.

## Milestone 1: Project Setup

- **Set up the development environment**:

  - Install Node.js, npm/yarn, and other required dependencies.
  - Initialize a new Next.js project with TypeScript.
  - Install necessary frontend libraries (React.js, Next.js, TailwindCSS, Web3.js, Ethers.js).
  - Set up a version control system (Git, GitHub).

- **Folder structure**:
  - Organize components, pages, and assets logically.

## Milestone 2: Basic UI Design and Components

- **Designing Core Layout**:

  - Create basic layouts: Navbar, Footer, Sidebar.
  - Set up a responsive layout using TailwindCSS.
  - Implement basic routing with Next.js.

- **Reusable UI Components**:
  - Design and implement common UI components:
    - Buttons
    - Forms (for login, sign up, and aid requests)
    - Cards for displaying data like aid, vendor information.
    - Modals for confirmations (e.g., transaction confirmation).
  - Ensure components are reusable and customizable.

## Milestone 3: Dashboard Development

- **Refugee Dashboard**:

  - Implement the refugee dashboard UI with sections for:
    - Digital wallet balance, transaction history.
    - QR code for payments.
    - Request form for aid (food, shelter, education).
  - Integrate with Web3.js to connect a wallet and fetch transaction details.

- **Vendor Dashboard**:

  - Display transaction tracking and services/products.
  - Implement functionality to manage aid credits and payments.
  - Display relevant data in easy-to-read cards and charts.

- **NGO/Admin Dashboard**:
  - Implement data analytics for aid distribution.
  - Allow verification of refugees via decentralized IDs (DIDs).
  - Set up fraud detection tools.
  - Allow vendor management for the NGOs.

## Milestone 4: Blockchain Integration

- **Web3 Wallet Integration**:

  - Implement wallet connection using MetaMask or other Web3 wallets.
  - Ensure the user can view their transaction history and send/receive aid credits.
  - Handle wallet disconnections and errors gracefully.

- **Blockchain Transaction Display**:
  - Use Web3.js/Ethers.js to display real-time transactions on the dashboard.
  - Use blockchain explorers to show transaction status and other details.

## Milestone 5: Advanced Features

- **AI-Powered Insights**:

  - Design and implement a dashboard section for AI-powered insights and predictions for NGOs.
  - Display predictive analytics like aid demand, region-based needs, and fraud detection.

- **Offline Mode**:
  - Implement offline capabilities for refugees who don’t have internet access.
  - Cache essential data and ensure the app works seamlessly offline.
- **Multilingual Support**:

  - Implement multi-language support for diverse users.
  - Ensure text and formatting adjust dynamically based on the selected language.

- **Gamification Features**:
  - Add gamified elements to encourage responsible use of aid credits (e.g., progress bars, badges).

## Milestone 6: Testing and Bug Fixes

- **Unit and Integration Testing**:

  - Write unit tests for all components using Jest and React Testing Library.
  - Implement integration tests for checking UI interactions with backend APIs.

- **Cross-Browser Testing**:

  - Ensure the app works seamlessly across different browsers and devices (desktop and mobile).

- **User Testing**:
  - Conduct user testing with real refugees and NGOs to gather feedback.
  - Adjust UI/UX based on the feedback.

## Milestone 7: Deployment and Documentation

- **Finalizing the UI**:

  - Ensure the UI is polished and error-free.
  - Double-check accessibility and compliance with WCAG guidelines.

- **Deployment**:

  - Deploy the application on Vercel, Netlify, or another preferred hosting service.
  - Set up continuous deployment (CD) pipelines for smooth updates.

- **Documentation**:
  - Write clear documentation on how to use the frontend components, how to connect to blockchain, and the app’s functionalities.
  - Ensure API documentation is up-to-date.

## Technologies to be Used:

- **Frontend**: React.js, Next.js, TailwindCSS, Web3.js, Ethers.js
- **Blockchain**: Aeternity UI, Web3 Integration with MetaMask, or other Ethereum-compatible wallets
- **Mobile**: Progressive Web App (PWA) support

## Conclusion

The frontend development for **RefAid** will focus on providing an accessible, user-friendly, and efficient interface for refugees, NGOs, vendors, and donors, all while ensuring seamless interaction with the blockchain. The roadmap emphasizes core milestones such as UI/UX development, blockchain integration, and advanced features like AI insights and offline capabilities.
